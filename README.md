## To Do List App

This project follows a really straight-forward tutorial to get a handle on Laravel basics. The app is built with Vue 2. As a result, some additional dependencies need to be installed if you create the app from scratch following the video.

- Scrypster's YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHSipe7pSac).

## Additional Dependencies

Run the following terminal commands after initial project setup with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation).

```
composer require laravel/ui
```
```
php artisan ui vue
```
```
npm i vue-loader
```
```
npm install && npm run dev
```

The default app.js file will contain extra code. I recommend removing it to match the tutorial for simplicity.
